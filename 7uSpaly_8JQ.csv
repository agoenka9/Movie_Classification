Just watched it recently and I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in recent times. So beautifully describes the journey of life and the characters that you come across in it.

192,"This is regarding Hindi movies. Bollywood is one the worst movie makers in the whole world. I can give you good examples. Have you ever imagined why Bollywood have not received a single Oscar? There are lots of other movies made in different countries who have received Oscar more than once or one at a time. Hindi movies are made in such a way that they miss something which helps them to stay behind from others in the sense of Direction, Screenplay, Editing and Story. I am trying to explain here not only the bending niche which Hindi movies directors lack but also how they make a real mess out of their own imagination. 
Hindi movies directors lack a sense of Art Direction in first place and in second they lack a sense of reality. Reality, I mean not to show the actual reality, but anything in the story either it's a fiction or non-fiction, the background and the main screenplay,
should look realistic. What they truly adhere is just their readymade movie script and relativity of characters without giving details to Artistic outcome. When you are watching a Hindi movie, just make a focus in the background or try to understand what's in the background of a movie. You will see that not only the set which is made for shooting looks fake and artificial but also the cloths of actors and actresses are very new and feels like they have purchased it just now from a luxury brand showroom and they are dancing and singing in the middle of the street or in a mountain area which is secluded from all human population. 
They do this because Indian people themselves are fools to watch this kind of rubbish that have no meaning at all and not really related towards day to day life. Regarding Screenplay, just imagine a person working in a
factory. He will surely have dirty clothes on him and his hands must be dirty all over. But, if you see a worker in Hindi movie, he is like a model and has luxurious cloth on him plus a nice hair style with sexy girlfriend dancing around him. Also, screenplay acts as a major visual focus to the movie. The details and production companies which do the entire background task should take advise from the directors for completion of reality based production and sequences.",2016-06-10T03:59:30.000Z,0
