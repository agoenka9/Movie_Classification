260,"This is regarding Hindi movies. Bollywood is one the worst movie makers in the whole world. I can give you good examples. Have you ever imagined why Bollywood have not received a single Oscar? There are lots of other movies made in different countries who have received Oscar more than once or one at a time. Hindi movies are made in such a way that they miss something which helps them to stay behind from others in the sense of Direction, Screenplay, Editing and Story. I am trying to explain here not only the bending niche which Hindi movies directors lack but also how they make a real mess out of their own imagination. Hindi movies directors lack a sense of Art Direction in first place and in second they lack a sense of reality. Reality, I mean not to show the actual reality, but anything in the story either it's a fiction or non-fiction, the background and the main screenplay, should look realistic. What they truly adhere is just their readymade movie script and relativity of characters without giving details to Artistic outcome. When you are watching a Hindi movie, just make a focus in the background or try to understand what's in the background of a movie. You will see that not only the set which is made for shooting looks fake and artificial but also the cloths of actors and actresses are very new and feels like they have purchased
it just now from a luxury brand showroom and they are dancing and singing in the middle of the street or in a mountain area which is secluded from all human population. They do this because Indian people themselves are fools to watch this kind of rubbish that have no meaning at all and not really related towards day to day life. Regarding Screenplay, just imagine a person working in a factory. He will surely have dirty clothes on him and his hands must be dirty all over. But, if you see a worker in Hindi movie, he is like a model and has luxurious cloth on him plus a nice hair style with sexy girlfriend dancing
around him. Also, screenplay acts as a major visual focus to the movie. The details and production companies which do the entire background task should take advise from the directors for completion of reality based production and sequences.",2016-06-10T03:58:02.000Z,14

I realized right away that it's the same plot. I thought it's a remake so I checked  this movie in google... what a shame! none was said about the original Korean writers... pfff! even an ordinary person like me knows copyright law... Didn't the writer realize this? I love Bollywood movies but I'm totally disappointed with this one... How  could they do a remake of a  movie without giving credit to the original? Didn't they even realize how easy  it is to share information these days...  very sad..﻿",2016-05-11T15:36:32.000Z,5

491,If any of you do plan to watch this film i'd say don't watch the Korean film Always (2011).The chemistry that  Hyo Ju Han & Ji Seob soo perfect  that you'd start hating this film even by watching the trailer. All that the curators have done is used Google translator and ripped off word by word of the story screenplay and worse even the dialogues .Robbery in the name of adaptation . Shameful .,2016-04-10T02:40:45.000Z,1
